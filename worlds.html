        <h2>Worlds & Sectors</h2>
        <p>The OASIS is a vast virtual universe divided into 27 sectors, organized in a structure reminiscent of a 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube, with each sector representing a unique zone or set of worlds. While not everyone could provide a comprehensive list of every world and sector, there are a few most commonly known.</p>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sectors: There are 27 sectors, each with its own theme or collection of worlds.</li>
            <li>Worlds: Each sector contains hundreds of thousands of individual worlds, which can be created, purchased, or themed by players and corporations.</li>
            <li>Sector Identification: Sectors are sometimes identified by the color of stars in their sky or by unique visual backdrops, which helps players recognize where they are within the virtual universe.</li>
        <h4>Sectors</h4>
        <p>While not every sector is named, several are incredibly well known and visited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Star Wars Galaxy Sector: Contains all Star Wars planets and settings.</li>
            <li>Star Trek Universe Sector: Dedicated to Star Trek worlds and environments.</li>
            <li>Larry Niven’s Known Space Sector: Includes settings like Ringworld.</li>
            <li>Fantasy Worlds: Sectors containing worlds like Middle Earth, Magrathea, and Discworld.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Worlds</h4>
        <ul>            
            <li>Ludus: The planet where schools are located; it is safe, with no monsters or adventure, making it difficult for players to gain experience points.
            <li>Middletown: Modeled after Halliday’s boyhood home, contains a recreation of his parents' house and is where the First Gate is completed.
            <li>Archaide: Features a hidden recreation of an arcade from Halliday’s hometown.
            <li>Frobozz: Contains a recreation of the text adventure game Zork.
            <li>Syrinx: Where the famed Crystal Key is found.
            <li>Chthonia: Location of Castle Anorak, Halliday’s private stronghold, and the Third Gate.
        </ul>
        <h4>World Creation</h4> Any player can buy or create a new world, so the number of worlds is constantly growing.
        <h4>Travel</h4> Players can travel between worlds using spaceships, teleporters, or special artifacts, with some sectors or worlds requiring specific technology or magic for entry.
        <h4>Sector Themes</h4> Some sectors are science fiction, others are fantasy, and some are mixed, with D&D regions and magical settings.</p>
