        <h2>Artifacts & Items</h2>
        <p>As you have no doubt discovered by now, there are many different items and artifacts scattered throughout the OASIS. Far too many to make a comprehensive list, anyways. Below are listed the special items that were created solely for and because of the OASIS. Not based on any sort of literature or media, not much is known about them. Only that they are very powerful and potentially dangerous.</p>
        <p>Cataclyst</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A one-time-use bomb that annihilates every avatar in a given sector, including the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fyndoro’s Tablet of Finding</p>
        <ul>
        <li>An artifact that reveals the approximate location of any avatar in the OASIS each day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Zemeckis Cube</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Allows the user to rewind time for a brief period within the OASIS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Copper Key</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The first of Halliday’s three keys; grants access to the First Gate.</li>
        <blockquote>
            The Copper Key awaits explorers<br>
            In a tomb filled with horrors<br>
            But you have much to learn<br>
            If you hope to earn<br>
            A place among the high scorers. 
        </blockquote>
