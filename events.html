        <h4>OASIS Historical Timeline: The Hunt for Halliday’s Egg</h4>
        <p>James Halliday Dies (Announcement of the Hunt)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>James Halliday, creator of the OASIS, passes away. He leaves behind a video message announcing the contest: the first person to find his hidden Easter Egg will inherit his fortune and control of the OASIS. The hunt begins, and Gunters (Egg hunters) across the world start searching for clues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Years of Searching</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For over two years, no one makes progress. Most people lose hope, but a few dedicated Gunters, including Parzival, Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Shoto, continue the search.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parzival Discovers the Copper Key</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival becomes the first to find the Copper Key by solving Halliday’s first challenge: a dungeon inspired by classic D&D and the arcade game Joust. He narrowly beats Art3mis to the key, sparking a rivalry and friendship.</li>
            <li>News of Parzival’s success spreads, and soon other Gunters, including Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Shoto, also find the Copper Key and enter the First Gate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Second Key and IOI’s Threat</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival and the other top Gunters race to solve the next clue. Parzival wins the Jade Key by completing a simulation based on the movie WarGames and later a challenge involving Halliday’s regrets about his lost love, Kira.</li>
            <li>IOI, a powerful corporation seeking to control the OASIS, discovers Parzival’s real identity. They offer him a job to help them find the Egg, but when he refuses, they bomb his home in the Stacks. Parzival survives by luck, but his family does not. He flees to Columbus, Ohio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Dance Party and IOI Attack</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival and Art3mis attend a dance party hosted by Ogden Morrow, Halliday’s former partner. IOI attacks the party, but Wade and Art3mis escape.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Third Key: Archaide and the Crystal Key</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival travels to the planet Archaide, where he finds an underground arcade. He completes a special Pac-Man challenge and wins the Crystal Key.</li>
            <li>After a period of inactivity, Parzival solves another challenge referencing the text adventure game Zork, securing another key and advancing the hunt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further Challenges and IOI’s Aggression</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival completes additional challenges, including one based on Blade Runner and another involving an obscure 80s rock song. He collects more keys and gains powerful items.</li>
            <li>IOI ramps up its efforts, kidnapping and enslaving Gunters who owe debts. Parzival is captured and forced to work for IOI, but he has a plan: he changed his identity to infiltrate their headquarters and disable a shield blocking access to the final challenge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Escape and Call to Arms</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival escapes from IOI and disables the shield. He broadcasts a call to all Gunters to join him in the final battle against IOI at Castle Anorak.</li>
            <li>Ogden Morrow contacts Parzival and Aech, providing them with a private jet to his home, where they prepare for the final confrontation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Final Battle</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thousands of Gunters gather outside Castle Anorak. A massive battle ensues between the Gunters and IOI’s forces. IOI uses a powerful artifact that kills everyone except Wade, who had an extra life.</li>
            <li>Parzival enters the castle alone, reenacts a scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and completes the final challenge. He wins Halliday’s Egg, inherits his fortune, and gains control of the OASIS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aftermath</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parzival uses his new powers to revive his friends and shares his fortune. He begins a new chapter, both in the OASIS and in the real world, with Art3mis by his side.</li>
        </ul>
